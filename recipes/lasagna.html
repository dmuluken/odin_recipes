    <h2>Home Made Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated home made lasagna recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound
            lean ground
            beef).</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of
            garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano,
            salt, and black
            pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles,
            but you can use the
            oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need
            shredded mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which
            means they hold the
            layer together).</li>
    </ul>

        </li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese layer:</strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley,
            the remaining salt,
            and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce
            and ending with
            mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour.
            Remove the foil and
            continue baking until the top is golden librown.</li>
    </ol>
